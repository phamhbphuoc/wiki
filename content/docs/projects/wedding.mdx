Building a Wedding Invitation Site with Astro
For our wedding, we wanted a beautiful, fast, and modern invitation website. Astro was the perfect choice for its simplicity, performance, and flexibility.

## Why Astro?
Astro is a cutting-edge static site generator that supports server-side rendering and seamless integration with modern frameworks. Its file-based routing and component system made it easy to organize our content and layouts.

## Hosting and Deployment
The site is deployed on Netlify, which offers fast global delivery and easy integration with Astro. With just a few configuration changes, our site was ready for production.
